# Returning for 2021: ROSES (Remote Online Sessions for Emerging Seismologists)

Following the success of the first ROSES offering in the depths of global lockdown, we are pleased to announce the return of ROSES for mid-year 2021. ROSES will run from June 8 to August 17, 2021. We welcome applications from MS students, PhD students, early career researchers and lecturers, and incoming graduate students that have already taken the [Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) Seismology Skill Building Workshop](https://www.iris.edu/hq/workshops/2021/01/ssb_2). We will continue to cultivate the successful, cohort-based learning environment while expanding accessibility globally – offering synchronous and asynchronous options for lectures, facilitating regional working groups, and providing a global forum for collaborative discussion. 

This year, ROSES will consist of 11 sessions (an introduction + 10 topical sessions) delivered via Zoom for live sessions and the ROSES YouTube channel for asynchronous sessions and general access. Live sessions will occur Tuesdays at 12pm EDT. Admission to the ROSES 2021 cohort will provide access to live sessions, the community Slack channel, and computational resource support. Applicants are expected to meet the following criteria:
1.	Be enrolled in / employed by an institution of higher education and/or research
2.	Be prepared to engage with at least 9 sessions and preferably all 11 sessions
3.	Be prepared to complete pre-session reading and coding-based pre-analysis assignments
4.	Meet the computational proficiency requirements:
* Familiarity with Unix commands (note: Windows users are welcome!)
* Familiarity with the Python programming language
* Familiarity with the ObsPy Python toolbox
* General familiarity with Jupyter notebooks
* Access to a Unix-based computing environment with a conda environment pre-installed (Note: ROSES will provide a cloud-based solution for Windows users)
* Elementary knowledge of git and GitHub for accessing course materials

Topics will focus on a combination of novel and upcoming topics in seismology, and topics that are useful for seismology students but may not be formally available via coursework at a university such as (subject to instructor availability):
* Metadata
* Digital Signal Processing for Seismologists
* Inversion - Tomography
* Inversion - Event Location
* Inversion - Full Waveform
* Distributed Acoustic Sensing
* Machine Learning
* Earthquake Physics
* Mapping + Figure Development
* Synthetics
* Seismo-acoustic Processing

Preference will be given to applicants who did not already participate in ROSES 2020.
